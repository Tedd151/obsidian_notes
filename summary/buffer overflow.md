A buffer is a temporary storage area in memory used to hold data while it's being transferred from one place to another.

A stack frame is a block of memory allocated on the program's stack for each function call. It stores the function's local variables, parameters, and return address. This facilitates structured programming by compartmentalizing function execution.

To return control to the caller after a function finishes, a **return pointer** is used. This pointer holds the memory address of the instruction immediately following the function call. This pointer is pushed onto the stack when the function is called.

The stack grows from high memory addresses towards low memory addresses.
